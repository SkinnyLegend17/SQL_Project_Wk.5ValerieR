# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
Some of my goals for this project is to get a better understanding of SQL and the types of processes of data analysis. I also hope to gain more practice with SQL and get better with my analysis and QA processes. 

## Process
### Step 1: The first thing that I did with the dataset is look through all the tables and columns and see if I can identify and rows that have missing values at a glance. If there are columns that have missing/null values, I would so these columns to run queries to verify and identify the missing data. 

### Step 2: The next step that I would do is note the columns that I would conduct a thorough analysis with. 

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

With the dataset, I discovered that there are several inconsistencies across several columns. In addition, there were a few columns that were completely empty and had duplicates. With these inconsistencies, I ran various queries that would verify and identify duplicate rows/values, as well as missing values in columns such as Country and City where values were "not set" or "not available in the dataset". 

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

One of the biggest challenges I faced in this project is ensuring data quality and accuracy, including handling outliers, duplicates, and inconsistencies. With these inconsistencies, it made it difficult to make meaningful query analysis across some columns where data was minimal. To tackle this, I removed duplicates and selected from distinct rows in order to obtain specific values. 


## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)

If I had more time, I think I would perform data normalization to ensure the dataset is well organized and has integrity. With this, it can eliminate any anomolies and improve the overall quality of the database.
